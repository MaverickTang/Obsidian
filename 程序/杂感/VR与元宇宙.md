## 本质
本质其实是下代互联网，从平面到立体。表现形式上，可以是（隔绝现实世界的）VR也可以是（和现实融合在一起的）AR，但一定都是立体的，沉浸式的

把建设元宇宙作为直接目标并不是建成元宇宙的最好方法，应该落实到具体的硬件产品上，解决应用问题，让其更普及，就像互联网公司完善自己的网站软件服务后，自然而然就形成了互联网


## 原理
VR与大部分计算机应用一样，本质是计算
两个镜片，于是需要对同一个视频计算得到左右眼视觉
对立体的物品，要根据近大远小的原理计算
3D模型最外层是贴图，内层其实是由一个个微小的多边形组成，多边形越多，图形越精细越逼真
对虚拟世界的模拟精细度的提高源于算法与算力


## 双刃剑
沉浸式，但终究不是现实世界，就像野生动物园，动物在回归野外中会出现问题，元宇宙就像是人类文明的野生动物园，如果呆久了，无法适应外面，动物园又出问题了，文明就只能被残酷的野外环境吞噬了



		The discussion about the metaverse has become hotter and hotter, and more and more started to have an interest in it. But what exactly is the metaverse and how does it work? 
	The metaverse is a network in which people interact with each other using three-dimensional figures, immersive and solid. Its foundations are virtual reality and Augmented reality. The virtual reality headset uses two screens simulating one's vision. The basis of every computer game is calculating data. VR application requires computers to calculate a lot of data. A 3D model is a mixture of thousands of polygons. The more polygons a subject has, the more delicate it becomes. Computers' tasks are calculating the polygons of the object, and sending video to the user in real-time. To have a more delicate model, we have to increase the computer's ability to calculate and design better algorithms to calculate. 
	Like many other technologies, VR is also a double-edged sword. For its immersive feature and imaginary design, people are likely to be addicted to it. Moreover, there is also privacy concern about the metaverse. Especially there are rape cases that happened in a virtual platform last year.
	To develop the metaverse into a better place that benefits humanity, serval measures need to be done to make sure VR is developing in a fast and safe way. Regulations, in the first place, should be made. And faster algorithms and better computers should be produced so that it engages more people in it. The more people use it, the stronger it gets.
