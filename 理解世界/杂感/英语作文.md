## Informal and colloquial writing

Academic writing is more formal than other kinds of writing. Some words or expressions that may be acceptable in emails, blog posts, or text messages are too informal for academic contexts and may come across as unsophisticated.

| **Informal word(s)** | **Replacement(s)**                                           | **Example**                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| America              | the United States, the US, the USA                           | The study focused on *America the United States*.            |
| bad                  | poor, negative                                               | The results were *bad poor*.                                 |
| big, humongous, huge | large, sizeable, significant                                 | A *huge significant* amount of evidence supports this theory. |
| has got              | has, must                                                    | The senator said that the government *has got to* *must* act. |
| get, got             | receive                                                      | The writer *got received* a prize for her work.              |
| give                 | provide, offer, present                                      | Table 5.2 *gives provides* evidence to support this conclusion. |
| good                 | optimal, strong, prime (or replace with a more descriptive adjective) | The findings were *good optimal*.                            |
| kind of, sort of     | somewhat, to some degree, in the category of                 | The scholar *kind of somewhat* agreed.                       |
| till                 | until, to, through                                           | The study will run from March *till until* May.              |
| show                 | demonstrate, reveal, illustrate                              | The interviews *showed revealed* a shared concern over safety. |

## Overly vague writing

Academic writing should be as precise as possible. Unambiguous language strengthens papers while vague wording can leave too much to a reader’s interpretation. Whenever possible, prefer exact values—percentages, measurements, statistics—to broader terms.

 

| **Vague word(s)**   | **Replacement(s)**                                           | **Example**                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| a bit               | Specify the exact amount or replace with the word *somewhat*. | The experiment required *a bit 10 mg* of the catalyst.       |
| a couple of/some    | Specify the exact amount or replace with *many, several, a number of*. | *A couple of* *A total of 30 students* were surveyed.        |
| a lot of, lots of   | Specify the exact amount or replace with *many, several, a great number of*, *significant*, or *numerous*. | The announcement received *a lot of significant* attention.  |
| a ton               | Specify the exact amount or replace with *many, several, a great number of*, *a substantial amount of*, or *significant*. | The government spent *a ton $5 million* on the project.      |
| and so on           | Either finish the thought, eliminate the phrase, or replace with a more specific phrase like *including other factors* or *additionally*. | Civil engineers must consider load, terrain, weather and *so on many other factors* when designing a bridge. |
| anything, something | Specify the item(s).                                         | The writer could be referencing anything.The writer could be referencing *three separate themes: the narrator’s grief, the uneasy political situation, or death in general.* |
| nice                | Specify the quality.                                         | It was a *nice colourful* painting.                          |
| most                | Specify the amount or replace with *many* or *the majority of*. | *Most* *Over 95% of* scientists support the measure.         |
| stuff, thing        | Specify the item(s), or replace with *object, sample, point,* or *finding*. | The report included lots of stuff.The report included *multiple relevant findings*. |

## Exaggerations

Academic writing should allow for reasonable doubt. While academic writers can be confident, they must acknowledge that their ideas and theories may be disproven. Avoid language that suggests absolute authority or knowledge.

Superlatives, such as *largest* and *best*, should be used only if they refer to provable facts (for example, describing a company as the largest in Europe) or if the writer is quoting another source (for example, saying that *Rolling Stone* ranked a certain recording as the best single of 2018).

| **Exaggeration**       | **Replacement(s)**                                           | **Example**                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| always                 | Specify the amount or replace with the word *frequently*.    | The results were always the same.The results were *the same over 120 iterations*. |
| definitely, absolutely | Eliminate or replace with *greatly, likely significantly*, or *strongly*. | The findings *absolutely provide significant* support for the proposed legislation. |
| every                  | Specify the amount or add a phrase to convey reasonable doubt, such as *almost, essentially,* or *recorded*. | Every *recorded* species of this *creature genus* is found in the Brazilian Amazon. |
| never                  | Specify the amount or replace with the word *rarely*.        | Surveyed respondents never chose the fourth option. *None of the 30* surveyed respondents chose the fourth option*.* |
| none                   | Specify the amount or add a phrase to convey reasonable doubt, such as *almost*, *essentially*, or *recorded*. | *None of the respondents answered positively.**None of the surveyed respondents answered positively*. |
| proves, proof          | *supports*                                                   | This finding *proves supports* the hypothesis.               |

## Too subjective or opinionated

In academic writing, arguments must be supported by evidence. Avoid words that imply conclusions based on the writer’s personal opinions; use objective language to support the main argument.

| **Subjective word(s)**                                | **Replacement(s)**                                           | **Example**                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| beautiful, wonderful, awful, ugly, hideous            | Specify the quality as objectively as possible.              | The composition was *awful full of clashing movements*.The building was *beautiful artfully designed*. |
| better                                                | Replace with a more objective word or phrase.                | The candidate had a *better more comprehensive* plan to address climate change than his opponent. |
| clearly, naturally, of course, obviously, undoubtedly | Eliminate or replace with a more objective word.             | *Naturally,* The programmer wrote the application in Java.*Of course**,* After the war, economic policy changed. |
| perfect, ideal, best                                  | Replace with a more specific qualifier or the words *strong, key,* or *crucial*. | The applicant was *the ideal a strong* candidate.            |
| should                                                | Explain the rationale behind the recommendation.             | Activists should study the protest.Activists *could benefit greatly from studying* the protest. |

## Clichés and colloquialisms

Clichés are overused expressions, while colloquialisms are those patterns of expression typical of informal speech. Besides making a paper appear too informal or conversational, they suggest that the writer doesn’t have a clear idea of what she’s trying to say. Replacing such phrases with more precise language will help improve the tone of your writing.

| **Cliché or colloquialism**                      | **Replacement**                                              | **Example**                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| a happy medium                                   | *a compromise*                                               | The two sides reached *a happy medium compromise*.           |
| a stumbling block                                | *an obstacle*                                                | The proposal encountered *a stumbling block an obstacle* when the opposing party mounted a negative press campaign. |
| above board                                      | *legitimate*                                                 | Unlike previous proposals, the resolution was *above board legitimate*. |
| at the end of the day, when all is said and done | *ultimately* or *in conclusion*                              | *At the end of the day* *Ultimately*, the new law did not impact the rural population. |
| get through                                      | Replace with a more specific verb or use *endure* or *survive*. | The researcher had to *get through read* multiple texts.     |
| in this day and age, in recent years             | Specify the time period or use *currently*, *presently*, or *today*. | *In this day and age* *In the past decade*, social media use has become prevalent amongst millennials. |
| think outside the box                            | Specify the idea or replace with words like *creative* and *innovative*. | The economist was known to *think outside the box propose innovative ideas*. |

## Filler words

Some words or phrases are superfluous in academic writing. Sentences tend to be stronger when they are removed.

| **Filler word(s)**  | **Replacement(s)**                                           | **Example**                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| literally           | Eliminate entirely unless you mean ‘in a literal manner.’    | The scientist had *literally* explored every option. The politician’s remarks were not intended to be interpreted *literally*. |
| really, too         | Eliminate or specify the quality.                            | The results were *really* *highly* revealing.                |
| serves to, helps to | Eliminate entirely.                                          | This quote *serves to illustrates* the author’s primary argument. |
| so                  | Eliminate entirely or replace with a more specific word.     | The poem is *so* interesting because it uses an unusual rhyme pattern. |
| very, extremely     | Eliminate the word or replace with *important, crucial, critical, significant, key*. | Her testimony was *very* useful.Her testimony was *crucial*. |

## Contractions

Contractions are the result of combining two words into one word, with the omitted letters shown with an apostrophe. For example, *don’t* is a contraction of *do not*. Contractions are considered too informal for academic writing and should be avoided.

| **Contraction**             | **Replacement(s)**                   | **Example**                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| can’t, won’t, don’t, didn’t | *cannot, would not, do not, did not* | The two substances *didn’t did not* react. |
| shouldn’t, wouldn’t         | *should not, would not*              | He *wouldn’t would not* support the vote.  |
| it’s                        | *it is*                              | *It’s* *It is* a common misunderstanding.  |
| I’d, I’ve, we’ve, she’s     | *I would, I have, we have, she is*   | *She’s* *She is* incapable of deceit.      |

## Language to consider carefully

**First or second person**

The first person (I/we/my/our) is not always deemed acceptable in academic papers. Consult your organisation’s guidelines about its usage. The first person may be allowed in some sections (such as the Acknowledgements) but not others (such as Methods and Results).

The second person (you/your) is almost never used in academic writing, though it may be appropriate in creative writing or personal communication. Remember that the second person also includes commands, such as *add 10 ml to the solution*. In most cases, the best way to avoid the second person is to restructure the sentence.

| **Person**               | **Replacement**                                              | **Example**                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| First person:I/we/my/our | Replace with a third-person actor (*the researcher, the writer*) or rewrite the sentence passively. | I performed a regression analysis.A regression analysis *was performed*.*The researcher* performed a regression analysis. |
| Second person: you/your  | Restructure the sentence or replace with a neutral term like *one* or *the reader*. | You might think that this result is unlikely.*Most of those who first heard this result found it unlikely*.The result *seems unlikely*.*It was an unlikely result* under the circumstances.*One might think* the result unlikely. |
