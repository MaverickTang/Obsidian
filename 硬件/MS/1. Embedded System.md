# Intro
An embedded system is a microprocessor-based computer hardware system with software that is designed to perform a dedicated function, either as an independent system or as a part of a large system. At the core is an integrated circuit designed to carry out computation for real-time operations.
# Basic structure of an embedded system 
## Sensor
The sensor measures and converts the physical quantity to an electrical signal, which can then be read by an embedded systems engineer or any electronic instrument. A sensor stores the measured quantity to the memory.
##  A-D Converter/D-A Converter
An analog-to-digital converter converts the analog signal sent by the sensor into a digital signal.  
A digital-to-analog converter changes the digital data fed by the processor to analog data
## Actuator
An actuator compares the output given by the D-A Converter to the actual output stored and stores the approved output.
## Processor (MCU)
Processors assess the data to measure the output and store it to the memory.
* Clock - keeps everything synchronised - 80 MHzfor our mbed
* CPU – the heart of the microcontroller – the ARM Cortex-M4is core in the mbed
* Instruction decoder – controlsthe chip, carries out actions for
* Input/output ports – serial, parallel, digital, analogue, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) etc
* Memory – program and data

## 不同种类的处理器
### CPU（Central Processing Unit）
中央处理器，内部分成了控制器CU和运算器ALU (Arithmetic logic unit)，数据来了，会先放到内存，控制器会从内存拿相应数据给到运算器进行运算，并会将结果返回到内存。当然，这只是简化的解释，实际会有取指令阶段、指令译码阶段、执行指令阶段、访存取数和结果写回等步骤
### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) 
图形处理，主要擅长做类似图像处理这样的，计算密度大，数据间相关性小的并行计算。这是因为GPU在设计时，不像CPU将大部分区域用于数据存储和控制，而是给计算单元分配了更多区域。这样可以为并行计算的每个数据单元执行相同程序，不需要繁琐的流程控制而提高计算能力。
### MCU (Moderate)
An MCU is an intelligent semiconductor IC that consists of a processor unit, memory modules, communication interfaces and peripherals.
### ASIC（专用集成电路）(Specific)
An application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC for short, is a chip created for a particular use or application, rather than for general-purpose use. They are usually made using silicon technology. Because of their uniqueness, they come in a many flavors and types.
### FPGA (现场可编程门阵列)(General)
field programmable gate arrays
是作为专用集成电路（ASIC）领域中的一种半定制电路而出现的，既解决了定制电路的不足，又克服了原有可编程器件门电路数有限的缺点。

# The instruction set
## Type
### CSIC (复杂指令集)

– Complex all encompassing instruction set

– Many microprocessors

– Some instructions are single clock cycle, more complex ones are several cycles (power vs. speed)

### RISC（精简指令集）

– Reduced instruction set of more simple commands

– Many microcontrollers

– Most commands operate in fewer clock cycles

– Pipelined architecture common

## The instructions for the CPU

### Machine language

– Fundamental basic instructions (instruction code)

– 10000000 : Or 0x80 : Add register B to accumulator

– Very easy to make mistakes, can be made optimum

### Assembly language（汇编语言）

– Mnenomics : ADD B

– Machine specific instructions

### Programming language

– + : but this also contains a fetch from memory, load into register

B, fetch from memory and load into accumulator, add and then

output accumulator to memory instructions

– General, ‘easy’ to write, inefficient

Microcontroller: Everything (CPU, RAM, ROM, I/O, and clock) on one chip. The memory (RAM/ROM) is fixed and mounted on the chip

Microprocessor: CPU is stand-alone and RAM, ROM, I/O, Clock are separate. Flexible in the amount of RAM/ROM amount
